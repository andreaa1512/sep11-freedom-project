* i started duing the tutorial on kaboom.js. while there are new terms, they seem pretty simple.
* rect() renders a rectangle. It accepts 2 arguments, the width and height, which we give it the game width (returned by width()) and height of 48 pixels
* pos() position. We give it a x: 0 and y: height() - 48 so it sits right on the bottom of the screen
outline() renders an outline of 4 pixels
* area() adds a collider to it
* body({ isStatic: true }) the object won't move, and all non static objects won't move past it
* color() makes it render with an RGB color, we give it a R: 127 G: 200 B: 255 which is a blue-ish color
