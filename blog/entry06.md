# Entry 6
##### 03/13/24


Now that the freedom project is finished, then we get to present to the class to prepare for the expo. 

In-Class Prensentations:

To know the order of who went for in-class presentations, Mr.Mueller had us fill out a form based on what number we wanted to go. When my turn came up, i was not as prepared. Even though the link to my project was not working, i still decided to "fake it til i make it". In my opinion, the presentation went smoothly, but I could've been more prepared.

SEP Expo:
The day of the expo cut through the in-class presentations. The point of the expo was to present out projects to professionals, and for everyone else to see it. When it was it my turn for the professionals to see my projects, I talked about the purpose of my progects, how i made it, and what tool i used to make the project. After I said my elevator pitch, they asked me questions as what was the hardest part of my project, and what inspired me to make the game.

Elevation Pitch:
  Hello, my project is about catching rubber ducks. The tool I used was kaboom.js. As you can see, there is a sprite at the floor waiting for the ducks and the homework. If you want to look at the code then the code it there. Thank you.
