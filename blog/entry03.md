To learn our tool, we had to first read on about it to get the jist of what kind of mechanics we would be using. Kaboom has many mechanics but they are all specified to do a certain job. The more important one would be the `add([])`.With this specific mechanic, you are able to add certain images or shapes to create a scenery. Mechanics like `onKeyPress()` is also a very important part becasue if you want a specific action to take placce when a specific key is pressed then that is the perfect mechanic to use. `loadSprite()` allows you to get a image from a specific folder and add it to your game as a character. There is specific categories that you have when you choose kaboom. From events, to components, to info, etc. Events are actions that would take part as an output. Components are specific changes that you want to happen. Some examples are `scale()`, `rotate()`, `color()`, etc. The next steps into making the project would be to put it in action.
