For this next part in our freedom project, we focused on learning our tool. The tool that i chose was kaboom.js. The way that i learned my tool was by doing the tutorial that came with the website. Before i did any coding, i first read through the tutorial. While reading i can see the code snippets and what i would like so i can see how it turns out. The first thing that the tutorial say is to first add `kaboom()` on the the top of the whole code by the "head". With that placed when you do http-server, then you see a checkerboard pattern. The next steps give you a "bean" picture. After you get your bean picture then the next few steps have you create a obstable course so the player can play and test the code. Some important notes that the tutorial gives is:

* add[()] is to add something
* rect() renders a rectangle. It accepts 2 arguments, the width and height, which we give it the game width (returned by width()) and height of 48 pixels
* pos() position. We give it a x: 0 and y: height() - 48 so it sits right on the bottom of the screen
* outline() renders an outline of 4 pixels
* area() adds a collider to it
* body({ isStatic: true }) the object won't move, and all non static objects won't move past it
* color() makes it render with an RGB color, we give it a R: 127 G: 200 B: 255 which is a blue-ish color

By knowing these "controls" then making anything in kaboom.js would be easy. My first steps for making fmy year long project is to make the background so then i know what i can add to make the river game.
