i have decided to chose the Kaboom.js as my tool. My project idea is a otter river game. More specifically an otter in a river with 3 lanes. Randomly in each lane will appear shells and you have to collect them.  But there will be bad shells. You need to avoid them, but if you mistakenly grab 3 them game over. The first thing I did to start tinkering is by looking at the introduction, and trying the tutorial. The tutorial gives a brief introduction on how kaboom works and its components.The first thing that the tutorial tells me to do is add `kaboom()` which would give us a blank canvas with a checkerboard pattern. After we add a chunk of code that would gives us a picture of a bean. Reading more of the tutorial, just gives us more expplanation of why what was showing on the screen was happening. Some key words to kabbom js are:
* sprite() makes it render as a sprite, with the "bean" sprite we just loaded with loadSprite()
* pos() gives it a position on screen, at X: 80 Y: 40
* area() gives it a collider area, so we can check for collisions with other characters later on
* body() gives it a physical body, making it fall due to gravity and ability to jump,
